# Master setup entrypoint for a fresh Project Archangel instance (Ampere A1
# or AMD Micro). Run this once on a brand-new box to get it from "just
# launched" to "fully set up" in one command:
#
#   git clone https://github.com/dwaipayanray95/Project-Archangel.git
#   cd Project-Archangel
#   ./infra/scripts/install-archangel.sh
#
# This is a thin orchestrator, not a monolith - it calls the individual
# setup scripts in infra/scripts/ in order. Each of those stays independently
# runnable and has its own re-run semantics (baseline_setup.sh is always
# safe to re-run; wireguard_setup.sh refuses to re-run without --force,
# since re-running it would silently invalidate every already-paired
# device). Keeping them separate means any one piece can be re-run in
# isolation later without repeating everything else - e.g. adding a 4th
# WireGuard peer, or re-deploying just the backend after a code change.
#
# As new milestones land (see the app/backend build plan), this script
# grows a new step each time - it's meant to be the canonical "how do I set
# this box up" answer, kept current as the project grows, not a one-time
# snapshot of what setup looked like on one particular day.
